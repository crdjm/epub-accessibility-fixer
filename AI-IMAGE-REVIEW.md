# AI Image Review Feature

## Overview

The EPUB Accessibility Fixer now includes an advanced AI image review feature that tracks and presents AI-generated alt text for manual review. This feature enhances the accessibility fixing process by providing a dedicated review interface for all images that received AI-generated alternative text.

## How It Works

### 1. AI Analysis Tracking
When the alt-text fixer processes images and generates alt text using AI (via Ollama, OCR, or metadata analysis), it now:

- **Captures image data**: Stores base64-encoded images for review
- **Records analysis details**: Tracks confidence scores, methods used, models, and timestamps  
- **Saves alt text**: Records the generated alternative text
- **Maintains context**: Links back to original file paths and sources

### 2. Review Page Generation
After processing, the system automatically generates:

- **Main HTML report**: Standard accessibility report with summary
- **Image review page**: Dedicated page showing images alongside their AI-generated alt text
- **Automatic linking**: The main report includes a prominent link to the image review page

### 3. Review Interface Features

The image review page provides:

#### Visual Review
- **Side-by-side display**: Images shown next to their generated alt text
- **High-quality preview**: Base64-embedded images for immediate viewing
- **Metadata display**: File paths, sizes, formats, and analysis timestamps

#### Analysis Information
- **Method badges**: Shows whether alt text came from AI vision, OCR, or metadata
- **Confidence scores**: Visual indicators of analysis confidence (High/Medium/Low)
- **Model information**: Displays which AI model was used (e.g., LLaVA, Moondream)

#### Review Controls
- **Approve/Revise/Reject**: Three-button system for quick review decisions
- **Revision editor**: Text area for improving alt text with suggestions
- **Status tracking**: Visual feedback showing review progress
- **Persistent storage**: Saves review decisions in browser localStorage

#### Quality Indicators
- **Color-coded confidence**: Green (high), yellow (medium), red (low confidence)
- **Analysis method indicators**: Different badges for AI, OCR, and metadata sources
- **File information**: Size, format, and analysis timestamp details

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/reporters/image-review-generator.ts`: Generates the image review page
- `AI-IMAGE-REVIEW.md`: This documentation file

### Modified Files
- `src/types/index.ts`: Added `AIImageAnalysis` interface and extended `ProcessingContext`
- `src/fixers/alt-text-fixer.ts`: Added image analysis tracking and storage
- `src/reporters/html-reporter.ts`: Added image review page generation and linking

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface AIImageAnalysis {
    imagePath: string;           // Absolute path to image file
    originalSrc: string;         // Original src attribute from HTML
    generatedAltText: string;    // The AI-generated alt text
    analysisMethod: 'ai' | 'ocr' | 'metadata';
    confidence: number;          // 0-1 confidence score
    model?: string;              // AI model name if applicable
    timestamp: string;           // ISO timestamp of analysis
    imageData?: string;          // Base64 encoded image data
    details?: object;            // Additional analysis details
}
```

### Workflow Integration
1. **During Processing**: Alt-text fixer calls `storeAIAnalysisResult()` for each AI-analyzed image
2. **Context Storage**: AI analyses are stored in `ProcessingContext.aiImageAnalyses[]`
3. **Report Generation**: HTML reporter checks for AI analyses and generates review page
4. **File Naming**: Review page uses pattern `{report-name}_image_review.html`

## Usage Examples

### When AI Image Review is Generated
The image review page is automatically created when:
- AI analysis generates alt text with confidence > 0.3
- Images are processed using Ollama vision models, OCR, or metadata extraction
- At least one image receives AI-generated alternative text

### Review Page Access
From the main HTML report:
```html
üñºÔ∏è AI-Generated Alt Text Review
Please review these for accuracy and appropriateness.
üìù Review AI-Generated Alt Text (View details)
```

### Review Interface
Each image entry shows:
```
Image 1: photo-chapter1.jpg
[AI Vision] [Confidence: 85%] [Model: llava:7b]

[Image Preview]
Source: images/photo-chapter1.jpg
Path: /tmp/epub-extract/images/photo-chapter1.jpg
Size: 245 KB | Format: .jpg | Analyzed: 8/31/2025, 1:23:45 PM

Generated Alt Text
"A person reading a book in a library with tall bookshelves in the background."

[‚úì Approve] [‚úè Needs Revision] [‚úó Reject]
```

## Review Guidelines

### What to Review
- **Accuracy**: Does the description match what you see?
- **Relevance**: Is it relevant to the content context?
- **Brevity**: Is it concise yet descriptive?
- **Accessibility**: Would this help screen reader users?

### Review Actions
- **Approve**: Alt text is acceptable as generated
- **Needs Revision**: Requires improvement (provides editing interface)
- **Reject**: Alt text is not suitable (manual replacement needed)

## Benefits

### For Content Creators
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual verification of AI-generated content
- **Efficient Review**: Batch review of all AI alt text in one place
- **Context Preservation**: See images alongside their descriptions
- **Edit Suggestions**: Built-in revision tools

### For Accessibility Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Documentation of AI-generated accessibility content
- **Quality Control**: Manual oversight of automated processes
- **Best Practices**: Guided review process for accessibility standards
- **Improvement Tracking**: Review decisions saved for future reference

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Batch operations**: Accept/reject multiple images at once
- **Export functionality**: Export review decisions to CSV/JSON
- **Integration**: Direct editing of EPUB files from review interface
- **Analytics**: Review statistics and quality metrics
- **Templates**: Pre-defined alt text patterns for common image types

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Images are base64-encoded for immediate display (no external dependencies)
- Review page loads independently of main report
- Large images are display-optimized while maintaining quality

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Uses localStorage for review state persistence
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet review

### Security
- All processing happens locally (no cloud services)
- Base64 images embedded directly (no external requests)
- Review data stored in browser only

This feature significantly enhances the accessibility fixing workflow by providing transparent, reviewable AI-generated content that maintainers can easily validate and improve.
